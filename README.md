# winforms-datavisualization-Net5
 Porting to .Net5 of dotnet/winforms-datavisualization project (https://github.com/dotnet/winforms-datavisualization)
 
# Data Visualization
This repository contains partial source code of the `System.Windows.Forms.DataVisualization` namespace that provides charting for WinForms. We ported and open sourced those components to enable charting features for WinForms applications that are developed on .NET Core 5.


## Getting started with Chart Controls
The best way to learn about Chart Controls is by looking at the [sample solution](https://github.com/AngeloCresta/winforms-datavisualization-net5/tree/main/sample) where via interactive experience with the app you can learn about every chart type and every major feature. While modifying the control parameters and instantly seeing how that affects the look of the control, you can also get the generated C# or Visual Basic code to use in your apps.
